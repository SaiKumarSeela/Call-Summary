Speaker,Summary
Speaker 1,"Emails about work include notifications, requests, and updates.
Typically, they are replied to shortly after receipt.
Receiving advertising emails is considered acceptable."
Speaker 2,"I receive many emails from my superiors and other departments, mostly to follow up on tasks or schedule meetings. I don't bother responding to emails unless the task has been completed, as I don't see the point in replying without taking action. Instead, I'd rather get the task done and then send the completed work, rather than sending a generic ""hello"" or ""thank you"". I don't think anyone would be interested in receiving such emails unless it's from a brand I like or they're having a sale."
Total Summary,"Speaker 2 receives many work-related emails from higher-ups, including reminders to complete tasks and schedule meetings. They don't normally reply to emails immediately, preferring to complete the requested work first and then respond with the completed task. They see no value in sending a generic ""hello"" or ""thank you"" response without completing the task. Speaker 2 is not a fan of receiving promotional emails, unless it's from a brand they follow or have a special interest in."
